Personally I think the style tiles are really nice. You can see how fonts and colors woork togethers and
draw inspiration from that. I don't like doing comps because I've never had good software for them. Having gimp
is far less usefull than photoshop in this instance and with that I lose some creativity by being limited 
by knowledge of the software. Working with the tiles is a little better in that respect. They took me less time 
and I felt them more usefull.
