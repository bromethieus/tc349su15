The site will not have a disscussion/forum section as previously
planned as it seems supurfluous to other online communities and 
it being absent from several other sites makes it seem unnessecearry.
Instead there will be galleries of tree photos loaded by users and 
they can discuss in the comment section if there is interest.

A general contact and event page will be another page where there 
would be static info such as phone numbers, meeting time and place, 
etc... as well as calendar or something to the same effect that
would should the next month worth of bonsai activities.

The homepage would describe the philosophy and direction of 
the club to represent the personallity befitting of the 
collective. As well there will be a descriptor of what bonsai
entails and some history.
