Small Cedars: Bonsai Club of Greater Lansing

	This site would be calm and inviting and appeal to those who enjoy the hobby of bonsai. Photos of bonsai would be central and tastefully done. The purpose would be to inform those interested in bonsai of times and locations of meetings, group collections, speakers, etc. to better spread the knowledge and popularity of this relaxing hobby. I have done a little research and found that Lansing is lacking any sort of bonsai club so I see an opportunity to make something real.
